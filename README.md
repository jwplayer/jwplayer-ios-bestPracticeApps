[^chromecastDisclaimer]: Unlike the other apps in this project which are *working* code examples, this app is a valid code example that nevertheless does **not** work as-is. 
Rather, it requires the **dynamic** build of the Google Cast SDK. As Google does not distribute this via CocoaPods, it must be [added manually](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender#manual_setup) to a given project — as we do not include external frameworks in our repositories. Please refer to our [documentation](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/ios-enable-casting-to-chromecast-devices) for more information.

## Setup

| :information_source: The project uses [cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) to manage dependencies. |
|-|

#### Steps to compile:
1. Make sure Xcode is closed.
1. In the Terminal app, navigate to the project's root directory.
1. To download and integrate the dependencies in the project, run: 
    ```console
    pod install
    ```
1. Open `JWBestPracticeApps-4x.xcworkspace`.
1. Add your [JWPlayer iOS SDK license key](https://support.jwplayer.com/articles/android-and-ios-sdk-reference#:~:text=HOW%20DO%20I%20GET%20THE%20IOS%20OR%20ANDROID%20SDK%3F%20HOW%20DO%20I%20USE%20THE%20SDKS%3F) to the AppDelegate for the target project:
    ```swift 
    JWPlayerKitLicense.setLicenseKey(<#Your License Key#>)
    ```
Now you can build and run the project.
