##  Google IMA Companion Ads - Best Practices App

A companion ad runs along with a VAST video ad (pre-roll, mid-roll or post-roll) to provide a more integrated experience for viewers. Companion ads allow you to serve ads to display ad slots at the same time as those served to a video or audio player.

The Google IMA Companion Ads project illustrates how to setup the player with Google's advertising (VAST video ad along with companion ads) using the Google IMA SDK.

> **Note:** The companion ad resource and creative event tracking pixels are not available while using Google IMA as ad client.

> **Note:** JWPlayerKit can request ads from any VAST-compliant ad server and manage ad playback through the Google IMA SDK.
